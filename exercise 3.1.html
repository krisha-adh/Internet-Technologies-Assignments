            <font color="white">
            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
       refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
       development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop
       browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has
       become ever-increasingly important.
