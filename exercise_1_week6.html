    <p>The Blue Macaw, also known as the Hyacinth Macaw, is the largest flying parrot species. Native to South America, it is known for its vibrant blue feathers, strong black beak, and yellow eye rings. These intelligent and social birds thrive in forests and grasslands, feeding mainly on nuts and fruits. Due to habitat destruction and illegal pet trade, their population has declined, making conservation efforts essential for their survival. </p>
